This is a serverless photography portfolio app, currently under development.

The goal of the finished application is to allow users to view and sort images by collections determined by the photographer, as well as search by keywords and view a portfolio page that holds the photographer's best work.

The user will be able to purchase images and receive the printed image, delivered to their address.
